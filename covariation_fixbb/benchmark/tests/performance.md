# performance test suite 
These tests are focused on checking how quickly Rosetta runs.

----
### performance
Run subsections of the Rosetta code, determining how many times a protocol can be run in a given amount of time.
Failure indicates a significant change in runtime, either slower (fewer cycles) or faster (more cycles).

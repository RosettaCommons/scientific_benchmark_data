These proteins are the ones from the enzdes_benchmark runs.

The corresponding PSSMs were generated with the 2.6.0 version of psiblast, using the BLAST nr database from 21May2014
(yes, both the psiblast and nr database were old when this was done in late 2018) with the following command:

    psiblast -query 1A99.fasta -db /path/to/db.21May2014/nr -out_pssm 1A99.chk -out_ascii_pssm 1A99.pssm -save_pssm_after_last_round
